## Processor Count

Write subroutine in x86 masm with the following prototype:

```c
unsigned int liczba_procesorow();
```

which returns number of processors in the system. Write example program in C language which proves that subroutine works as intended.

Tip:
Use `GetSystemInfo` function from WinAPI (description can be found on msdn.microsoft.com)
